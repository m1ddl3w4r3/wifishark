##Welcome to the WIFIShark Profile (80211 WIFI RFCTF)

Created with the idea that there was not a "Red Team" 80211 profile for Wireshark
This was a small passion project with a few ideas
Dont do 7000 colors you have to remember
Show things important to doing a redteam event (like the RFCTF)
Things like:
IVs
Handshakes
Deauths



##Instalation

install it in the same way you would any other profile in Wireshark
